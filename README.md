# Short study on the learning design of an Information Security course

This repo describes a short study to evaluate the learning design of [a module 
on authentication](https://github.com/OpenSecEd/auth).


# What is the problem to be solved?

RQ1: How to unlearn something very reinforced and relearn the correct? (From 
identity-based authentication with passwords to attributes and crypto.)

RQ2: How long do the students retain this?


# Do you want to support the learners, the teacher, or some external or internal evaluator, or someone else?

# What learning activities do you address?

# What is the motivation for the analysis?

# Are there any important ethical considerations (e.g., privacy)?

# What type of data you need and arrange for collecting them?
